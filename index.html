    <h2> Entrepreneurship & innovation 💡</h2>
    <p> Before arriving in the MS Innover et Entreprendre of ESCP, I did 4 years of business school in Lille where I was able to learn many things about project management, financial mathematics or corporate law. 📊 Now, I can finally apply in the real world all the elements I have learned. </p>

    <h2> Sports 🎾 </h2>
    <p> I have been playing tennis since I was 6 years old. I played competitively and was ranked 15/4. Today, not having much time to train, I go to the gym every two days to keep in shape and to blow off steam.  </p>
